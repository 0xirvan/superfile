You can edit your superfile config file with the following command:

```bash
$EDITOR config_path
```

:::tip
To see the path locations of your superfile files, use the command `spf pl`.
:::

### Setting

- ###### theme

[Click here](/configure/custom-theme) for instructions to edit the theme.

- ###### editor

The editor your files/directories will be opened with (if blank, it will default to the EDITOR environment variable).

- ###### auto_check_update

`true`  => Checks whether updates are needed when you exit superfile (only checks once a day).

`false` => No checks performed.

- ###### cd_on_quit

:::note
This doesn't work on Windows at the moment.
:::

`true` => When you exit superfile, navigates the path of the terminal to the path of the last file panel you used.

`false` => The path of the terminal remains the same as before you ran superfile.

After setting to `true`, you need to update your `.bashrc` file.

Open the file:

```bash
$EDITOR ~/.bashrc
```

Copy the following code into the file:

<CodeBlock file="cd_on_quit/cd_on_quit.sh" />

Save, exit, and reload your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

- ###### default_open_file_preview
`true` =>  The file preview panel opens automatically every time you open superfile.

`false` => The file preview panel will not open automatically when you open a superfile.

- ###### file_size_use_si
`true` => The file/directory sizes will be displayed using powers of 1000 (kB, MB, GB).

`false` => The file/directory sizes will be displayed using powers of 1024 (KiB, MiB, GiB).

- ###### default_sort_type
Sorting types of the file panel. Directories will always be displayed at the top.

`0` => Name

`1` => Size

`2` => Date Modified

- ###### sort_order_reversed
Sorting order of the file panel.

`false` => Ascending (a-z)

`true` => Descending (z-a)

- ###### case_sensitive_sort
Case sensitive sort by name (upper "B" comes before lower "a" if true).

`true` => Case sensitive ("B" comes before "a")

`false` => Case insensitive ("a" comes before "B")

### Style

- ###### transparent_background
`true` => If enabled, the background color will not be rendered (transparent). This is useful if your terminal background is transparent.

`false` => If turned off, the background will be rendered (with color) to maintain theme consistency.

- ###### default_directory
The default location every time superfile is opened, supports `~` and `.`

- ###### file_preview_width
This setting is an integer.

`0` => When it is 0, it means that the width of the File preview panel will be the same as that of the File panel.

`X` => When it is any other number, it means that the width of the File preview panel will be the width of the entire panel (total width of the terminal - width of the sidebar) divided by X.

:::caution
The number of entries must be from 2 to 10
:::

- ###### sidebar_width
This setting is an integer.

`0` => If the number is 0 then the sidebar will not display.

`X` => This number will be the width of the sidebar width.

:::caution
Figures must be 3-20
:::

```toml
# ...
border_top = "━"
border_bottom = "━"
border_left = "┃"
border_right = "┃"
border_top_left = "┏"
border_top_right = "┓"
border_bottom_left = "┗"
border_bottom_right = "┛"
border_middle_left = "┣"
border_middle_right = "┫"
#...
```

```toml
# ...
border_top = "─"
border_bottom = "─"
border_left = "│"
border_right = "│"
border_top_left = "╭"
border_top_right = "╮"
border_bottom_left = "╰"
border_bottom_right = "╯"
border_middle_left = "├"
border_middle_right = "┤"
#...
```
