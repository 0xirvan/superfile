You can enter the following command to set it up;

```bash
$EDITOR config_path
```
You can first go to the [theme list](/list/theme-list) to find a theme you like (or if you don'wqt have one you like, you can make one yourself!)

Once you find one you like, copy it and paste it into the theme in the config_path file.

```diff
- theme = 'catpuccin'
+ theme = 'theme_name_you_like'
```
