## Plugins

[Click me to the plugins wiki](https://github.com/yorukot/superfile/wiki/Plugins)

## Themes

### Use an existing theme

You can go to [theme list](https://github.com/yorukot/superfile/blob/main/THEMELIST.md) to find one you like!

> We only have a few themes at the moment, but we will be making more overtime! You can also [submit a pull request](https://github.com/yorukot/superfile/pulls) for your own theme!

copy `theme_name` in:

```
Theme name: theme_name
```

Edit `config.toml` using your preferred editor:

> [!TIP]
> If your OS is macOS the file path should be in the `~/Library/Application Support/superfile/config.toml`

```
$EDITOR ~/.config/superfile/config.toml
```


and change:

```toml
theme = "gruvbox"
```

to:

```toml
theme = "theme-name"
```

### Create your own theme

If you want to customize your own theme, you can go to `~/.config/superfile/theme/YOUR_THEME_NAME.toml` and copy the existing theme's json to your own theme file

Don't forget to change the `theme` variable in `config.toml` to your theme name.

[If you are satisfied with your theme, you might as well put it into the default theme list!](#contribute)

## Hotkeys

[**Click me to see the hotkey list**](https://github.com/yorukot/superfile/wiki/Hotkey-list)

> [!TIP]
> If your OS is macOS the file path should be in the `~/Library/Application Support/superfile/hotkeys.toml`

**You can change all hotkeys in** `~/.config/superfile/hotkeys.toml`

> "Normal mode" is the default browsing mode

Global hotkeys cannot conflict with other hotkeys (The only exception is the special hotkey).

The hotkey ranges are found in `hotkeys.toml`
